# 180-Days-DSA-Challenge
# 📝 LeetCode Daily Solutions

Welcome to my **LeetCode Daily Solutions** repository! 🚀

In this repo, I will be uploading **at least 5 solutions** to LeetCode problems every day, covering various topics of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This project is part of my daily learning routine to improve problem-solving skills, prepare for coding interviews, and strengthen my understanding of DSA concepts.

## 📅 Daily Goal
- Solve **at least 5 LeetCode problems** each day.
- Continuously cover a variety of topics and problem difficulties.
- Maintain detailed explanations and optimized solutions.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered
Throughout this repository, I aim to cover various DSA topics, such as:

- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Hashmaps
- Binary Search
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming
- Graphs & Trees
- Greedy Algorithms
- Sorting & Searching Algorithms

## 🔍 Problem Format

Each problem solution is stored in its respective topic folder with a consistent format:

- **Problem Title:** A brief title of the problem.
- **Difficulty Level:** (Easy/Medium/Hard).
- **Problem Description:** A summary or link to the problem description on LeetCode.
- **Approach:** Explanation of the thought process and approach.
- **Time & Space Complexity:** An analysis of the time and space complexity of the solution.
- **Code Implementation:** The solution in Python/C++/JavaScript (or your language of choice).
